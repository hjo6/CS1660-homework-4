Welcome to my repository for the 4th homework assignment for CS1660 Fall Term
2020. You can find my input files for the Least5.JAR file under the Input Files
directory, you can find my screenshots with the results file in the Screenshots
and Output directory, and you can find the source code (with the compiled JAR)
under Source Code and JAR.
